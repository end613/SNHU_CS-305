Software Security

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required secure web software capable of protecting client data and ensuring the integrity of sensitive information. The company’s main concern was the security of its existing application, which needed encryption for sensitive data, protection against vulnerabilities, and compliance with modern secure-coding standards. To address these needs, I conducted a full vulnerability assessment using OWASP Dependency-Check, implemented SHA-256 checksum functionality for data verification, and configured HTTPS with a self-signed SSL certificate generated through Java Keytool to enable encrypted communication. These changes collectively hardened the application against data breaches and ensured that any transmitted information would remain confidential and tamper-proof. 

During the vulnerability assessment, I carefully reviewed dependency reports, suppressed false positives, and confirmed that only verified libraries were used. The most helpful aspect of this process was learning how each dependency contributed to overall application security and identifying where potential exploits could occur. I increased layers of security by adding cryptographic hashing, enforcing HTTPS, validating configurations, and testing functionality to ensure that security enhancements didn’t interfere with performance. After refactoring, I re-ran static scans to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. The combination of secure coding practices, Maven dependency analysis, and functional testing ensured the final code was both safe and fully operational. These tools—particularly OWASP Dependency-Check, Java Keytool, and Maven—will continue to be valuable in future work. For prospective employers, this project serves as an example of my ability to perform real-world secure software development, identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and produce maintainable, standards-compliant Java applications that reflect sound security and engineering principles.
